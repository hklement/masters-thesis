This chapter covers the concepts that \tool is based upon. At first, Section~\ref{section:requirements} states the requirements of the system. Subsequently, Section~\ref{section:development-environment2} deals with our decision in favor of a web-based development environment. Section~\ref{section:code-execution1} describes the secure and flexible approach for executing learners' code submissions. Section~\ref{section:hint-generation1} discusses why learners should be supplied with helpful hints and outlines \tool's method for providing them. Section~\ref{section:assessment2} presents the selected approach towards the assessment of code submissions. Finally, Section~\ref{section:interoperability1} states the need for interoperability with existing e-learning tools and introduces \tool's approach in this regard.
