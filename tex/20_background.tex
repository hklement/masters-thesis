This chapter provides background on several subjects associated to the topic of this work. Section~\ref{section:moocs} focuses on \moocs. Subsequently, Section~\ref{section:openhpi} presents the German \mooc provider openHPI, which constitutes the research context of this thesis. Section~\ref{section:practical-programming} discusses the role of practice in programming education. Section~\ref{section:web-based-applications} deals with web-based applications in general and web-based development tools in particular. Section~\ref{section:assessment1} covers assessment of programming assignments and describes approaches that permit scalable assessment in large-scale programming courses. Section~\ref{section:development-environment1} introduces options for providing learners in \moocs with programming tools and compares their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, Section~\ref{section:competition} examines a handful of exemplary development environments used in \moocs that teach programming to beginners.
