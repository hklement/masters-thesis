This chapter focuses on the implementation of our application. Section~\ref{section:building-blocks} introduces the building blocks that \tool is constructed from. After that, Section~\ref{section:domain-model} presents the application's domain model. Section~\ref{section:development-environment3} deals with the web-based development environment provided to learners. Section~\ref{section:code-execution2} illustrates the application's code execution approach, which is based on Docker. Section~\ref{section:hint-generation2} describes the process of hint generation. Subsequently, Section~\ref{section:assessment3} looks into the internals of \tool's automated assessment method. Section~\ref{section:interoperability2} covers the application's interoperability workflow. In the end, Section~\ref{section:content-creation} depicts the usage of \tool from a teacher's perspective.
