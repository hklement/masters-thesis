I want to express my gratitude to everyone who supported me in bringing this thesis to completion.

At first, I want to thank my supervisors Prof. Dr. Christoph Meinel, Jan Renz, Thomas Staubitz, and Christian Willems, whose ideas, guidance, and support were of great value to me. Likewise, I want to thank Ralf Teusner for his assistance.

Many thanks go to my fellow students who shared an office with me. The pleasant working atmosphere as well as our joint lunch, coffee, and frisbee breaks were excellent motivators. Furthermore, I will keep Fridays’ vegetarian burgers in good memory. Special thanks are directed to Dominic Petrick who has gone with me through the various stages and challenges of writing a master’s thesis.

I want to thank Josefine Harzmann for her steady encouragement, her culinary support, and her tolerance for late hours and weekend work.

Moreover, I want to thank the people who took the time to review parts of my work.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to my parents for supporting me during my studies.
